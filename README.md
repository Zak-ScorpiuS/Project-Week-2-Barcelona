## Database
We created a database with 6 tables,  we tried to get it done with sequel pro or mysql to have the ERD, unfortunately wasn't possible, so we draw the ERD

## Workflow
The steps were to brainstorm the questions we wanted to answer first, then we deep dived the web searching for datasets, we couldn't find enough info for our questions, then we aimed to answer what we could.

## Organization
We used trello for organisation, breaking the project into small steps and followed them.

Our repository is quite simple, since we couldn't create a database, we used pandas, therefore we attach the data files (.csv's) together with the jupyter notebooks used.
